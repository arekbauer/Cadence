## ‚ú® Features

- Secure Spotify Login: Authenticate using the official Spotify Android SDK for a seamless
  and secure login experience. The app gracefully falls back to a web-based flow if the Spotify app is not installed.

- Your Listening Stats: View your top tracks and top artists from different time periods: the
  last month, the last six months, and the last 12 months.
  
- Genre Deep Dive: Discover the micro-genres that truly define your musical taste. Cadence analyzes your listening history to create a ranked list of your most-played specific genres.

- Artist Pages: Dive deeper into your favorite artists with dedicated pages that showcase their top songs and full album discography, all within the app.

- Popularity Score: See where your taste falls on the spectrum from "Underground" to "Mainstream." Cadence calculates a unique popularity score based on the artists and tracks you listen to most.

- View Your Albums: Browse and explore the albums from your saved music library.

- Home Screen Widgets (Coming Soon): Keep your top tracks and artists at your fingertips with beautiful home screen widgets.

  
## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project follows modern Android architecture guidelines and leverages a suite of powerful libraries:

    UI: 100% Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 expressive for a responsive user interface.

    Architecture: Follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.

    Dependency Injection: Hilt for managing dependencies and decoupling components.

    Networking: Retrofit 2 for type-safe HTTP calls to the Spotify API, with OkHttp as the HTTP client.

    Asynchronous Programming: Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for managing background threads and data streams.

    Navigation: Jetpack Navigation Compose for navigating between screens.

    Authentication: Spotify Android SDK for a native authentication flow.

## üöÄ Setup

To build and run this project yourself, you will need to provide your own Spotify API credentials:

    Get Credentials: Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard and create a new application to get your Client ID and Client Secret.

    Configure Your App: In the Spotify Dashboard settings for your app, add the following Redirect URI: cadence-app://callback.

    Add Your Keys: Add your credentials to the local.properties file like this:

    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here

    Sync the project in Android Studio, and you should be ready to build and run the app.
