# Cadence

Cadence is a modern Android application built to explore personal Spotify listening statistics and discover new music. This project serves as a practical exercise in building a feature-rich app using the latest Android development technologies, including Jetpack Compose and the official Spotify Android SDK.  

## ‚ú® Features

- Secure Spotify Login: Authenticate using the official Spotify Android SDK for a seamless
  and secure login experience. The app gracefully falls back to a web-based flow if the Spotify app is not installed.

- Your Listening Stats: View your top tracks and top artists from different time periods: the
  last month, the last six months, and the last 12 months.

- Sonic Profile: Get a unique analysis of your musical taste. Cadence analyses the audio
  features of your top tracks to reveal your personal "sonic profile," showing you whether you lean towards music that is energetic, danceable, acoustic, or happy.

- Genre Deep Dive: Discover the micro-genres that define your listening habits. Cadence goes
  beyond broad categories to show you a ranked list of your most-played specific genres, from "permanent wave" to "garage rock revival."

- Intelligent Recommendations: Get song recommendations based on a selection of your favourite
  tracks or artists. Perfect for building the ultimate playlist.

- New Release Radar: Never miss a new drop from your favorite artists. Cadence checks for new
  albums and singles from the artists you follow and listen to most, keeping you up-to-date.
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project follows modern Android architecture guidelines and leverages a suite of powerful libraries:

    UI: 100% Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 expressive for a responsive user interface.

    Architecture: Follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.

    Dependency Injection: Hilt for managing dependencies and decoupling components.

    Networking: Retrofit 2 for type-safe HTTP calls to the Spotify API, with OkHttp as the HTTP client.

    Asynchronous Programming: Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for managing background threads and data streams.

    Navigation: Jetpack Navigation Compose for navigating between screens.

    Authentication: Spotify Android SDK for a native authentication flow.

## üöÄ Setup

To build and run this project yourself, you will need to provide your own Spotify API credentials:

    Get Credentials: Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard and create a new application to get your Client ID and Client Secret.

    Configure Your App: In the Spotify Dashboard settings for your app, add the following Redirect URI: cadence-app://callback.

    Add Your Keys: Add your credentials to the local.properties file like this:

    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here

    Sync the project in Android Studio, and you should be ready to build and run the app.
